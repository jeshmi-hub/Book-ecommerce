       <h2>The Valkyires</h2>

        Paulo and his wife, Christina travel to the desert for a forty day quest into the Mojave Desert. In the desert, they encounter the Valkyries. 
        The Valkyries are strange warrior women who travel on motorcycles. Paulo is confronting his past and the question why we destroy the things we love. 
        The book is a modern day magical adventure. Paulo Coelho poses a question: why do we destroy that which we love?

        To break this curse he has to set out on the Mojave Desert and find the Valkyries, warrior women who ride around on powerful motorbikes and in the desert converse with angels.
        
        The setting is tense and obscure; the real Paulo is human and full of his own questions. His knowledge of the desert is questioned when he and his wife set out on a long walk through the mysterious sand dunes. They set themselves free by letting their nude bodies be devoured by the tragic sun. The suspense builds when his wife Christina first learns to quiet her second mind, and figures out how to talk with her Angel, before he does.
        
        I found Paulo Coelho's The Valkyries a bit of  a mystery. I suspect that its author, at least in part determined so. In short, the author tries to discover new aspects of his psyche, to develop new angles on his existing skills. to leave after a consultation with his mentor, he and his wife for a trip to the Mojave Desert to find what they seek.
